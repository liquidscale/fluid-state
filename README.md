# LQS Fluid State Platform

This is the monorepo for the whole Fluid State Platform, which is a Stateful FaaS platfom running natively in Kubernetes. The platform is open-source and can be used and extended to fit your needs. But if you need to run LQS FSP in an enterprise context, we're maintaining a commercial enterprise version of certain components for massive scalability, improved security and other common usage patterns found in enterprusec contexts (advanced workflows, monitoring, IoT, etc).
