# LQS Dev/Test Cluster

In order to improve development experience and streamline testing, we provide a lightweight development cluster that exposes the same global API to run engines, functions and scopes, without having to rely on Kubernetes and complex setup to create and test your functions and scopes. To use the development cluster, just install LQS tools (`npm install -g @liquidscale/tools`)  and, from your system project root, just execute `lqs dev watch`.
